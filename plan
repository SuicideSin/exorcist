Week 0:
	-Now able to read files from a pcap or network stream painlessly...with application data in it.
	-HTTP application data is removed.

Week 1:
	-Checking for Windows MZ and PE flags.
	-Counting NOPs and maximum consecutive NOPs.
	-"Seems" to reliably pick out Windows binaries and NOP sleds.

Week 2:
	-Still building statistics on false positives/false negatives.

Next Week:
	-Try running with multiple file captures.
	-Find false-positive rate/false-negative rate.
	-Implement same system for Linux (stretch).
