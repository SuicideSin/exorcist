Week 0:
	-Now able to read files from a pcap or network stream painlessly...with application data in it.
	-HTTP application data is removed.

Week 1:
	-Checking for Windows MZ and PE flags.
	-Counting NOPs and maximum consecutive NOPs.
	-"Seems" to reliably pick out Windows binaries and NOP sleds.

Week 2:
	-Still building statistics on false positives/false negatives.

Week 3:
	-Implemented finding Linux binaries in C++ version.
	-Went to find some better PCAPS:
		-http://contagioexchange.blogspot.com/
			-Currently brute forcing passwords...
			-Since you have to email author...and there's no response...
		-http://laredo-13.mit.edu/~brendan/regin/pcap/
		-http://panda.gtisc.gatech.edu/malrec/
	-Realized I was looking for attacks rather than malware...
	-Created a python version of this project:
		-Includes getting raw streams from pcaps and parsing HTTP/HTTPS files.
		-Thinking there was probably file extractors out there...not really...
		-BRO looks like it does exactly what I'm doing...

Week 4:
	-Decided application layer is the way to go (raw PE and such get random stuff in them).
	-Currently carving HTTP/HTTPS (single and chunked connection).
	-Compared with NetworkMiner, all file hashes are the same so far.

Week 5:
	-Did absolutely nothing...

Next Week:
	-Add other services (tftp, ftp, etc?)
	-Run through virus total or something?
