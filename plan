Week 0:
	-Now able to read files from a pcap or network stream painlessly...with application data in it.
	-HTTP application data is removed.

Next Week:
	-Try to remove application data for common protocols:
		-ftp
		-AIM (for sake of having example pcaps)
	-Come up with heuristics for checking for malware:
		-Hashes?
		-Diffs?
		-Straight binary comparison?
